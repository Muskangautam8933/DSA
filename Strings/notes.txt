string is used to store array of character and sentence

First we should know that how to take input of a string
String str = sc.nextLine() // nextLine() method give the output of full nextLine
String str = sc.next()  //next method print only single word it break after any single space


Method And Operationg of string
1) charAt() = this method is used to acces any single character of string

example :
String str = "Muskan"
sout(str.charAt(4));
output = a

2)length() =  this method is used to acces the whole string 

exmaple:
String str = "Muskan"
sout(str.length(str));



3) indexOf() = this method is used to get the index of any character in a string
exmaple:
String str = "Muskan"
sout(str.indexOf(n));
o/p = 4

* if there is repeated element in the string then we can access like this:
exmaple:
String str = "Muskan Gautam"
sout(str.lastindexOf(m));
o/p = 12

* if the character is not present in the string then it return -1.

4) toLowerCase() = this method covert all the character to  toLowerCase
exmaple:
String str = "Muskan Gautam"
sout(str.toLowerCase());
o/p = muskan gautam

4) toUpperCase() = this method covert all the character to upper case
exmaple:
String str = "Muskan Gautam"
sout(str.toUpperCase());
o/p = MUSKAN GAUTAM

5) contains() = this method is used if the string contains or not it return true or false
example:
String str = "harshita";
sout(str.contains('harsh'))

6) compareTo() = this method is used to compare two string if the fisrt character of both is not matched then the further string is not compared
example:
        String a = "Harshita";
        String b = "Namrita";
        System.out.println(a.compareTo(b));

7) concat() = this method is used to join two string
        
        String c = "Harshita";
        String d = "Namrita";
        System.out.println(a.concat(b));

        
Two practice question:
1) WAP to count the number of vowels in a string

2) WAP to check if the number is palindrome or not.
palindrome string is the type of string in which we read the string same as front or back
example: mom = reverse is also mom

# How to convert integer to string
Integer.toString() = this method is used to convert int to string
String s = Integer.toString(n);
System.out.println(s);

#)Integer.parseInt() = this method help your to add numbers
String str = "45674";
int num = Integer.parseInt(str);
System.out.println(num+1);

#) toCharArray() = this method is used to convert to string to character array
example :
String s = "Ruhan";
char a[] = s.toCharArray();
for(char ch : a){
    System.out.println(ch);
}

#)substring() = this method is  used to print the substring from a string.
example :
String s = "Harshitam";
System.out.println(s.substring(4));


#)StringBuilder = StringBuilder is a class in programming commonly found in java that is used to create mutable sequence of characters

Mutable vs. Immutable: In many programming languages, standard String objects are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once they are created. If you perform an operation that seems to modify a string (like concatenation), the system actually creates an entirely new string object in memory.

Efficiency: A StringBuilder, on the other hand, is mutable. It allows you to modify the content (append, insert, delete characters, etc.) of the existing object directly in its memory location without creating new objects each time.


Purpose: This makes StringBuilder much more efficient and faster, especially when you need to perform many string manipulations, such as building a long string within a loop.


Thread Safety: StringBuilder is typically not "thread-safe" (meaning it shouldn't be accessed by multiple parts of a program simultaneously without extra handling), which makes it faster than its thread-safe counterpart, StringBuffer

*)this is how we actually create StringBuilder:
StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("Muskan");

StringBuilder method
str.append()
str.setCharAt()
str.reverse()
str.insert()
str.update()
str.delete()
str.toString()
and there is lots more method in StringBuilder
