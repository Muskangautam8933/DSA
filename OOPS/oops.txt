1) Classes : Classes are the blueprint or template of objects in class we define our data type
2) Objects: objects are the real world entity in the object we initialoze the value with the help of object we can access class

3) Passing object to methods:if we send object in the function then it is called pass by reference

4) Polymorphism : polymorphism means multiple form
The word polymorphism means having many forms, and it comes from the Greek words poly (many) and morph (forms), this means one entity can take many forms.

we use polymorphism because:
Code Reusability:
Flexibility: 
Abstraction:

Types of  polymorphism :

i) Compile time polymorphism - 
        method overloading: multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. 

ii) Run time polymorphism -  
        method overriding: The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

5) private access modifies: The private keyword is an access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class.
